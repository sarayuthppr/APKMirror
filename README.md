# APKMirror

I decided to continue developing this app myself, as vojta-horanek has stopped development on it.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TacoTheDank/APKMirror.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/TacoTheDank/APKMirror)

An unofficial apkmirror client/web application (forked from the original, which is now abandoned).

Anyone may contribute (I need better translations, and better code review because I don't actually know much about Android development). Make a pull request with changes to contribute I guess...

i honestly have no clue what the hell im doing lol

Original app by vojta-horanek: https://github.com/vojta-horanek/APKMirror

The last version (3.5) from vojta-horanek can be found here at XDA Labs: https://labs.xda-developers.com/store/app/cf.vojtechh.apkmirror

Features:

    Quick loading (for the most part)
    Custom download managers
    Clean material design
    Small-ish APK size (could be smaller tbh)

<b>Screenshots:</b>

Currently getting replacement screenshots for a more accurate representation.
