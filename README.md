# APKMirror

I decided to continue developing this app myself, as vojta-horanek has stopped development on it.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TacoTheDank/APKMirror.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/TacoTheDank/APKMirror)

An unofficial apkmirror client/web application (forked from the original, which is now abandoned).

# Develop branch: Any commits and pull requests go to THIS branch, as it is the debug branch for new things before they can be considered stable.
# Master branch: Stable code is here. Rebase merges from Develop to Master will be fairly frequent.
## This setup will probably change at some point to be more understandable, but until then...um...~~fuck you lmao~~

Anyone may contribute (I need better translations, and better code review because I don't actually know much about Android development). Make a pull request with changes to contribute I guess...

i honestly have no clue what the hell im doing and can hardly figure out git please help me
